    <h1>ABOUT:</h1>
    <p>sara shaikh is an artist based in new york city. she started WILDCARD as a way to revive discarded fabrics and make a positive impact on the environment. using the ancient sun-dying technique of cyanotype, every design is a unique creation, embodying the spirit of a wildcard—unexpected and one-of-a-kind. every item in the WILDCARD collection is crafted from sustainably sourced and upcycled materials. each piece tells a story, reflecting the journey of the wearer and celebrating personal expression through art.
    </p>
    <p>
    WILDCARD is not just a brand; it's a movement towards a more sustainable and artistic future in fashion. thank you for being a part of this journey.</p>
