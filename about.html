    <h1>ABOUT:</h1>
    <p>Sara Shaikh is an artist based in New York City. She started WILDCARD as a way to revive discarded fabrics and make a positive impact on the environment. Using the sun-dying technique of cyanotype, every design is a unique creation, embodying the spirit of a wildcard—unexpected and one-of-a-kind.
        </p>
    <p>
      Her pieces in WILDCARD are deeply inspired by the connection between humans and the natural world. Her work explores the intricate relationship between people and their environments, with a particular focus on feminine narratives and the representation of women’s experiences, celebrating their identity through art. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Each piece in the WILDCARD collection is crafted from sustainably sourced and upcycled materials, telling a story that reflects the journey of the wearer while celebrating personal expression through art. WILDCARD is a brand of creative freedom and a movement towards a more sustainable and artistic future.
